## Conducting Effective Conversations

Follow these steps to run productive AI sessions with domain experts.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Prompts" icon="edit">
    Define clear objectives. Focus on one topic per conversation, such as "Explain the customer onboarding process step-by-step."

    <Callout kind="tip">
      Start with open-ended questions like "Walk me through your daily workflow" to uncover hidden knowledge.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Engage the Expert" icon="user">
    Record the conversation in real-time. Probe deeper with follow-ups: "Why do you prefer this approach over alternatives?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Capture Raw Insights" icon="file-text">
    Transcribe responses immediately. Note non-verbal cues or examples provided.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Structuring Outputs

Organize conversation transcripts into structured formats for AI consumption and searchability. Use these patterns to standardize knowledge.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JSON Schema" icon="code">
    Structure insights as key-value objects for database ingestion.

    <CodeGroup tabs="Prompt,Output">
```prompt
Extract the onboarding process from this transcript and output as JSON with fields: steps (array), prerequisites (array), common_pitfalls (array).
```

````json
{
  "steps": [
    "Verify user email",
    "Send welcome kit",
    "Assign initial tasks"
  ],
  "prerequisites": ["Account approval"],
  "common_pitfalls": ["Skipping email verification"]
}
````
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Markdown Documentation" icon="file">
    Generate readable docs with sections for quick reference.

    ```markdown
# Customer Onboarding

## Steps
1. Verify email
2. Send welcome materials

## Pitfalls
- Forgetting verification leads to support tickets.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Reviewing and Editing Knowledge

Validate structured outputs to maintain quality.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Review Checklist" default-open="true">
    - Accuracy: Does it match the original conversation?
    - Completeness: Are edge cases covered?
    - Clarity: Is it concise yet detailed?
    - Searchability: Include keywords experts use, like `onboarding pitfalls`.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Editing Workflow">
    Use collaborative tools to iterate. Tag experts for feedback on specific sections.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<Callout kind="alert">
  Always version your knowledge base. Track changes to see how expertise evolves.
